      I have a full-time research position in an organic synthesis lab. 
      My daily routine consists of setting up reactions and chromatography columns, doing NMR experiments,
      and sometimes MS and IR experiments, as well as a looot of troubleshooting and reading.
     My project for this summer is mastering the synthesis of
      recently reported 1,1,9,9-Tetramethyl[9](2,11)teropyrenophane, which is a super cool molecule you can read more about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29272562/">here</a>. 
      For my upcoming Honours project, I will be working on functionalizing the abovementioned molecule.
